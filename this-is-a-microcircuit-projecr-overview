# MicroCircuits Overview
This folder has a series of what we call micro circuits. Each micro circuit performs a single function. Any project will eventually be an assembly of such micro circuits.


###Micro circuits will be built using the following key microcontrollers and programming languages:

- Arduino Nano in Arduino C
- Raspberry Pico (WH) in microPython
The code for the Nano will also run on the following microcontroller, which will be used for WiFi communication.

ESP8266 NodeMCU

The code for the Nano will also run on the following microcontrollers which are more powerful but not necessary for basic circuits.

ESP32 (Arduino C)
STM32 (Arduino C)
